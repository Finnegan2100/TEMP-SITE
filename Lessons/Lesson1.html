<p>
Ok, let's get started here.
</p>
<p>
First off, I work out of Notepad++ and I run my code in Chrome. For debugging I use the Javascript Console located in the top-right corner
of your browser window. In Chrome, just click on the three horizontal lines, go to "tools", then go down to the bottom where it says "Javascript console".
</p>
<p>
Voila' - a window will appear at the bottom with a bunch of cool tools to help you with your Javascript coding experience. We'll mostly be interested in the little 
red circle with an "X" that will (but hopefully won't) appear at the bottom right and indicate which line you messed your code up on. 
That's going to be a heck of a life-saver, especially as we get into the heavy-duty stuff.<p>
</p>
<p>
Another savior here - assuming you don't know ANY Javascript and will be following along (brave soul!) is the console.log() method. Hoo boy, does that
help out when you're stuck in the thick of things. Console.log() is the Javascript cousin of our dear friend trace() if you come from an Actionscript background.
But enough about all this stuff. We'll have more than enough time to discuss them later.
</p>
<p>
Here we have a skeleton html file. Write or copy the following into your text editor of choice:
</p>
<p>



<div id = "code">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br />
&lt;title&gt; Ben is a super cool dude. &lt;/title&gt;<br />
&lt;canvas id = &quot;canvas&quot; width = &quot;550&quot; height = &quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;script&gt;<br />
&lt;/script&gt;<br />
</div>

</p>
<p>
Ok, so you don't need to add the part about me being amazingly cool. Add whatever you like there.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who don't know ANYTHING about HTML, this is the basic setup for your files. ACTUALLY, this is more ideal for
the experiments we'll be looking at today since I've omitted the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags in order to focus our attention on the &lt;canvas&gt; tag
and what it can do. But here you have it - a skeleton file all ready to be filled with good old Javascript.
</p>
<p>
Say, Ben, what is Canvas anyway?
</p>
<p>
Well, it's an element used for displaying all kinds of neat stuff that was never before possible to display with previous versions of HTML.
To have your mind blown, check this out: 
</p>
<p>
<a href= "http://craftymind.com/factory/html5video/CanvasVideo.html">Canvas Explosion! </a>
</p>
<p>
Pretty neat, huh? This stuff can be done in HTML5 thanks to the good old Canvas element. Can't do THAT in Flash!
Bet you're itchin' to start making this stuff yourself! 
Speaking of Flash, if you come from a Flash background, you'll notice that the graphics API has a lot of things in common with what I'm going to
be showing you over the next couple lessons. But it's also a heck of a lot different...frustratingly so at times! Arghh!
</p>
<p>
But before we dive in, I just want to clear the roads for any of you who don't know anything about working in a text editor/how to run your javascript
in the browser.
</p>
<p>
Let's do this step by step:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Download Notepad++ for free from the Notepad++ website or whatever. </li>
<li> Install Notepad++.</li>
<li> Open Notepad++ and start a new file.</li>
<li> Copy the code highlighted in light grey I wrote earlier onto Notepad++.</li>
<li> Save the file as an HTML file.</li>
<li> At the top, under "run" click "Launch in Chrome".</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
And there you have it! You should see NOTHING except the text written in the title tag. But you'll start seeing stuff soon enough. 
</p>
<p>
So now that you're all caught up, let's dive in and start messing with the canvas.
</p>
<p>
First off, let's return to our skeleton HTML file from before:
</p>
<p>
<div id = "code">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br />
&lt;title&gt; Ben is a super cool dude. &lt;/title&gt;<br />
&lt;canvas id = &quot;canvas&quot; width = &quot;550&quot; height = &quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;script&gt;<br />
&lt;/script&gt;
</div>

</p>
<p>
What does this contain? Well, the thing that may stick out the most for you HTML heads is canvas. Note that I've attributed an id of "canvas" to it. This
will be important a bit later when we connect our HTML and Javascript by means of the canvas.
Also note that I've given the canvas a width and height of 550 X 400. These are the dimensions I've always 
used for my Flash games, and they work just fine here too. Feel free to change them around as we proceed. Just don't get carried away just yet.
</p>
<p>
So wait a second...why don't we see the canvas when we run this little bit of code? Well, that's because the default color of the canvas is white. To change that, why
don't we add some CSS to the code like this:
</p>
<p>

<div id = "code">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br />
&lt;title&gt; Ben is a super cool dude. &lt;/title&gt;<br />
&lt;style&gt;<br />
canvas<br />
{<br />
background-color: #333333;<br />
}<br />
&lt;/style&gt;<br />
&lt;canvas id = &quot;canvas&quot; width = &quot;550&quot; height = &quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;script&gt;<br />
&lt;/script&gt;
</div>
</p>
<p>
...and you'll see a nice dark grey background in the 550 X 400 space occupied by the &lt;canvas&gt;. Try any color you like. Just don't
get too carried away, wiseguy! 
</p>
<p>
So now we're going to learn two VEEERY important lines of code:
</p>

<div id = "code">
document.getElementById("theCanvas");<br>
theCanvas.getContext("2d");
</div>

<p>
These will be useful for a LOT of stuff, so get your memorizing hats on for this one! 
Now these two lines should be placed between the two &lt;script&gt; tags as they are Javascript code.
</p>
<p>
Like this:
</p>
<p>
<div id = "code">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br />
&lt;title&gt; Ben is a super cool dude. &lt;/title&gt;<br />
&lt;style&gt;<br />
canvas<br />
{<br />
background-color: #333333;<br />
}<br />
&lt;/style&gt;<br />
&lt;canvas id = &quot;canvas&quot; width = &quot;550&quot; height = &quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;script&gt;<br />
var theCanvas = document.getElementById(&quot;canvas&quot;); // &lt;----------------Put 'em right here!<br />
var context = theCanvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);                <br />
&lt;/script&gt;<br />

</div>
</p>
<p>
Now with the first of these beautiful lines of code, you're accessing the &lt;canvas&gt; HTML tag which we ID'd as "canvas".
With the second, we're determining the context which our canvas will use. In our case we'll be using "2d". 
The other option is "webgl", but don't use it since this is for 3d stuff and isn't fully supported as of yet. That is, unless
you're reading this in the future! Deeeep!
</p>
<p>
Remember that whatever you name the variable on the second line, you will write OVER and OVER again, especially when
drawing lines and stuff, so don't go crazy can call it something like "theContextOfMyHTMLFileHeyWhatABeautifulDayItIsToday" because
it's going to slow ya down. And in this fast-paced life, we can't afford to be slowed down!
</p>
<p>
So these two lines set up your canvas for you. Now let's try to add something to it just for fun!
</p>
<p>
Directly underneath the two lines you just wrote, add the following:
</p>
<p>
<div id="code">
context.fillStyle = "#ff0000";<br>
context.fillRect(200,200,50,50);
</div>
</p>
<p>
...then run it and tweet me what you see at @benwhi 
</p>
<p>
So that's it for part one - I hope you'll follow along as we dig into the basic functions of the canvas API
with shapes, lines, arcs and other neat stuff.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for following along! Code didn't work for you? Hate me? Are you my illegitimate child? Send input anytime!
</p>
<p>
Until tomorrow!
