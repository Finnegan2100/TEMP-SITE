<h1>
AN INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT
</h1>
<p>
I've decided to write this as a sort of primer for those of you who have absolutely no experience in working with Javascript. Here we'll talk about the fundamentals
of the language, namely variables, arrays, functions, loops and the like. It's meant to give you the tools necessary to use these tutorials even if you're a complete
beginner and have never written a line of code in your life. Within each introductory lesson you'll find a number of practical, hands-on examples geared towards helping 
you master the techniques discussed.
For those of you who HAVE written code before, but who have never worked with Javascript, this primer will also be a useful reference for you as well.
</p>
<p>
I'll try to to structure this primer in a way to let you easily skip around to each topic for reference. When all the lessons are complete I'll include a keyword search option.
</p>
<p>
So without further ado....

<h2>
GETTING STARTED IN JAVASCRIPT FOR GAME DEVELOPMENT
</h2>
<p>
Javascript is a weakly-typed, object-oriented, prototype-based language.
</p>
<p>
If this is your very first programming language, you can forget all that, since it's not going to be useful to you until you get a handle on the basics.
What you'll really need to know is that, in poor man's words, Javascript is used quite frequently in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create interactive web pages - and games! - and 
that's precisely why we'll be studying Javascript in these lessons.
</p>
<p>
Since you're interested in using Javascript for making games, I won't be going over the history of the language or the glorious path it took to arrive in the 
Olympus of languages. I won't be getting super techy either. You can learn that stuff later. We'll just be dissecting the basics of the language piece-by-piece in order to provide you 
with a good enough understanding to get through this on your own. First stop: variables!
