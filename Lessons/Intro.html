	      <h1>HTML5 GAME DEVELOPMENT  - AN INTRODUCTION </h1>

<p>
Hey everyone!
</p>
<p>
This is the first of what will hopefully end up as roughly a month's worth of HTML5 Game tutorials. 
While this will not be a complete and exhaustive look at all the available features, I will 
teach you quite a few game dev. tricks inherited from the days o' Flash which can be fully 
integrated into HTML5 and, more importantly, give you a very good grasp of the basics 
of the &lt;canvas&gt; element: a novelty in HTML5 and, as you'll see, an important part of game development.
</p>
<p>
I'll be going at this with straight, raw Javascript. No engines and no libraries...just the way I like it.
</p>
<p>
Before we start tomorrow, here's a list of a few things we'll be covering throughout the month:
</p>
<ul>
<li>How to set up a "skeleton" HTML file: the groundwork on which we'll be building our games.</li>
<li>Basic &lt;canvas&gt;activities: drawing lines, arcs, shapes, etc.</li>
<li>Extra canvas goodies like drop shadows, fills, gradients, etc.</li>
<li>How to implement timers with setInterval(), SetTimeout() and the new and exciting requestAnimationFrame().</li>
<li>How to do basic trasformations such as tweaking rotation, changing alpha, scaling, etc.</li>
<li>How to use sprite sheets in your games.</li>
<li>Moving an object around the screen.</li>
<li>Collision detection.</li>
<li>Setting screen boundaries.</li>
<li>Velocity, acceleration, gravity, friction.</li>
</ul>
<p>
...and a LOT more stuff, too.
</p>
<p>
These tutorials assume you have a basic understanding of either Javascript or Actionscript 3.
I'll try to be as concise and simple as I can.
Oh, and you'll need a text editor too.
</p>
<p>
So let's work together and make a couple of HTML5 games, shall we?
</p>
<p>
I hope you'll check these out. You have my promise I'll give them 100%. 
</p>
