<p>
Hey there, everyone. It's raining! 
</p>
<p>
Today we're going to go into the nooks and crannies of some other features of the canvas. There's not much left to cover
here, so I'm assuming we'll only need two or so more lessons before we can move on to the more "gamey" stuff. 
Gotta say we've covered a lot of stuff in these lessons! Somewhere I think I mentioned wanting to talk about event listeners sometime soon, 
but first we'll canvas stuff first for completion's sake. Like I said, we're almost there. 
And now that we've finished rotation and scaling, the hard part is now behind us.
</p>
<p>
So what are we going to talk about today? Let's start off today by looking at something called compositing. Now compositing
is a technique for dealing with overlapping stuff. It's like a mini version of those newfangled Photoshop blend tools (or whatever kids call them today)
like subtract, difference, multiply, etc. that you can use to combine colors sitting top of each other in different ways.
</p>
<p>
Once again, a visual representation is much easier, so let's jump right into our coding and try a few.
</p>
<div id = "code">
<br />
&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br />
&lt;title&gt;RECTANGLE BLENDING&lt;/title&gt;<br />
&lt;canvas id = &quot;canvas&quot; width = &quot;550&quot; height = &quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;<br />
&lt;style&gt;<br />
canvas<br />
{<br />
background-color: #dddddd;<br />
}<br />
&lt;/style&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;script&gt;<br />
<br />
var theCanvas = document.getElementById(&quot;canvas&quot;);<br />
var context = theCanvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);<br />
<br />
<br />
context.fillStyle = &quot;#ff0000&quot;;<br />
context.fillRect(200,150,60,60);<br />
context.fillStyle = &quot;#00ff00&quot;;<br />
context.fillRect(170,130,60,60);<br />
<br />
&lt;/script&gt;
</div>
<p>
Here are our two rectangles. One is red and one is green.
</p>
<p>
An important thing to note here before we get blendin', since we haven't dealt with it in the past, is the ORDER in which you place objects onto
the canvas. The order in which they are specified in your code will be the order in which they are drawn onto the canvas. Notice that the
first rectangle we drew was red, followed by the second green rectangle. This places the red rectangle underneath the green one.
</p>
<p>
If we take a second and switch the four lines as you can see here:
</p>
<div id = "code">
<br />
context.fillStyle = &quot;#00ff00&quot;;<br />
context.fillRect(170,130,60,60);<br />
context.fillStyle = &quot;#ff0000&quot;;<br />
context.fillRect(200,150,60,60);
</div>
<p>
...the green rectangle is placed magically below the red one. If we were to draw a third, say, blue rectangle,
it would be placed BELOW the lowest one, in this case our green one.
</p>
<p>
But before we get all mixed up with the stuff we're about to try, I want to be sure we're on the same page here, so
SWITCH YOUR CODE BACK to the first, longer code example above. We want the red rectangle BELOW the green 
one for this exercise. Catch my drift? Switch it back right now. Or you an use a time machine and smack yourself on the head
before you did the last exercise. Either way.
</p>
<p>
So, here we are again back with our red rectangle on the bottom. 
</p>
<p>
The code for compositing is simply this:
</p>
<p>
context.globalCompositeOperation = "whatever type of compositing operation you prefer goes here";
</p>
<p>
There are eleven compositing operations total and we'll start picking them apart in a minute.
</p>
<p>
But first. it's very important to know that there are two fundamental concepts inherent to compositing: the destination and the source.
The SOURCE goes to the DESTINATION. Got it?
</p>
<p>
Again, I feel the need to sing in my best operatic voice....
</p>
<p>
"THE SOOOUUUUURRCCCEEE GOOOOESSS TOOOO THEE DEEESSTTTINNNATTTTIOOOOOOONNNNNNNN......"
</p>
<p>
Had a kind of Mozartian feel to it, don't you think? 
</p>
<p>
So wait, where does the SOURCE go?
</p>
<p>
Aha! It goes to the DESTINATION! Sing it to yourself a couple times around the house. It helps those of us without a memory cap 
to keep things stored in our brains.
</p>
<p>
Remember folks, that you need to put the context.globalCompositeOperation BETWEEN the source and destination. 
</p>
<p>
Now, just so we can see what's going on, let's add an example of compositing to our code right now:

</p>
<div id ="code">

&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br />
&lt;title&gt;RECTANGLE BLENDING&lt;/title&gt;<br />
&lt;canvas id = &quot;canvas&quot; width = &quot;550&quot; height = &quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;<br />
&lt;style&gt;<br />
canvas<br />
{<br />
background-color: #dddddd;<br />
}<br />
&lt;/style&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;script&gt;<br />
<br />
var theCanvas = document.getElementById(&quot;canvas&quot;);<br />
var context = theCanvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);<br />
<br />
<br />
context.fillStyle = &quot;#ff0000&quot;;<br />
context.fillRect(200,150,60,60);<br />
<br />
context.globalCompositeOperation = &quot;source-atop&quot;;<br />
<br />
context.fillStyle = &quot;#00ff00&quot;;<br />
context.fillRect(170,130,60,60);<br />
<br />
&lt;/script&gt;<br />
</div>
<p>
Now that's intreresting! What happened there?
</p>
<p>
Well, our compositing operation is called "source-atop" and that cuts away 
all the source that ISN'T overlapping with the destination and leaves you
with the portion that was overlapping it.
</p>
<p>
Now switch the compositing operation to "source-over". What was THAT supposed to do?
Nothing! It's the default for compositing! Obviously, this means that the source
is placed over the destination. Something we know already from our song.
</p>
<p>
Now give your compositing operation a value of "source-out". This cut away 
all the destination and all the source that was touching it, leaving us only the outer
source.
</p>
<p>
Try "source-in" now. This gives you only that bit of source that was overlapping
with the destination. The opposite of "source-out", in other words.
</p>
<p>
So, as you can see, there are four different values for source:
</p>
<p>
ATOP,OVER,IN,OUT
</p>
<p>
In other words: "source-atop","source-over","source-in","source-out".
</p>
<p>
Let's take a look at the destination values, then!
</p>
<p>
Change your context.globalCompositeOperation value over to "destination-atop".
What do you see? This gives you only the destination that touched the source
and put it on top.
</p>
<p>
"destination-over"? This simply switches the order of the two rectangles on the canvas.
</p>
<p>
By the way... where does the source go??  
</p>
<p>
"THE SOOOUUUUURRCCCEEE GOOOOESSS TOOOO THEE DEEESSTTTINNNATTTTIOOOOOOONNNNNNNN......"
</p>
<p>
That's right!
</p>
<p>
Now for the last two:
</p>
<p>
Plug in "destination-out", then "destination-in". Pretty much what you expected, right? Cool.
This is the same thing as source-out and source-in, but with the destination as our protagonist.
</p>
<p>
Now there are three more oddball values to deal with that don't start with source or destination.
</p>
<p>
They are:
</p>
<p>
COPY, LIGHTER and XOR.
</p>
<p>
No, XOR doesn't make your rectangles grow green antennae and fly off to another planet. Despite the wierd name, all it does is...
put a big hole where the overlap was. You'll see that in a second.
</p>
<p>
First let's look at COPY.
</p>
<p>
Go ahead and assign "copy" to your composite operation line. 
</p>
<p>
This one's sorta boring. All it does is copy the source to the canvas without changing it and gets rid of the destination.
</p>
<p>
Try "lighter" now. Hmm, we get a yellow rectangle in the overlapping section of the source and destination.
Lighter adds the two image values together and gives you a corresponding color.
</p>
<p>
How about that oddball "xor"? As you can see it cuts out all the interlapping space between the two rectangles.
</p>
<p>
Take some time to check these out. They're sort of fun, actually! Try them with lineTo-based filled shapes as well.
</p>
<p>
Here's a complete list of all the compositing values in case you fell asleep:
</p>
<p>
source-out
sorce-in
source-over
source-atop
</br>
destination-out
destination-in
destination-over
destination-atop
</br>
copy
lighter
xor
</p>
<p>
Now the next topic I want to introduce deals with something called clipping. Clipping is actually your third option if you don't want to
use stroke() or fill(). Bascially what it does is this:
</p>
<p>
When you assign a certain area as a clipping region, anything that you draw outside of the region will not be seen. In this next
bit of code, you'll see a "floral" for lack of a better word) sort of clipping region made with curves.
</p>
<div id = "code">

&lt;script&gt;<br />
<br />
var theCanvas = document.getElementById(&quot;canvas&quot;);<br />
var context = theCanvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);<br />
<br />
context.strokeStyle = &quot;#000000&quot;;<br />
context.moveTo(200,100);<br />
context.quadraticCurveTo(250,50,300,100);<br />
context.quadraticCurveTo(400,150,300,200);<br />
context.quadraticCurveTo(250,250,200,200);<br />
context.quadraticCurveTo(100,150,200,100);<br />
context.stroke();<br />
context.clip();<br />
<br />
&lt;/script&gt;
</div>
<p>
Notice that when you save and run this code, you'll see no change whatsoever. The real fun comes when we try to add some
rectangles to ths canvas. Check it out:
</p>
<p>
Add this code underneath your clipping region.
</p>
<div id = "code">

context.fillStyle = &quot;#00ff00&quot;;<br />
context.fillRect(200,100,150,150);
</div>
<p>
TRAPPED! As you can see, anything you draw outside your clipping region will be removed. The rectangle, of course, was drawn normally, but you've set the "floral" shape 
as your clipping region and that makes everything outside it invisible. This blocks your inner child that wants to color outside 
the lines. It's a mask, in other words.
 </p>
<p>
I don't think it's necessary to show you any other examples of this. It's pretty self-explanatory, right? I think you're
proficient enough at this point to be able to stand on your own two feet with this one.
</p>
<p>
A last thing I need to go over with you is how paths work in the canvas. I've skipped over this until now because I didn't want to 
confuse you, but now, as we're covering the last few topics related to the canvas, I'd say this requres our attention.
It can allow you to get a lot more creative with your lines and arcs.
</p>
<p>
Now, as you've noticed if you've experimented around with drawing long sequences of lines and arcs: once you set a strokeStyle
to a line, it seems like you're stuck with that for eternity! What if we want to draw different colored lines? Let's try something and see if it works for us.
</p>
<p>
In this example, I've tried closing off the line with a stroke() method, then assigning a new strokeStyle to our line and starting again.
Let's see if it works:
</p>
<div id = "code">

&lt;script&gt;<br />
<br />
var theCanvas = document.getElementById(&quot;canvas&quot;);<br />
var context = theCanvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);<br />
<br />
<br />
context.strokeStyle = &quot;#000000&quot;;<br />
context.moveTo(200,200);<br />
context.lineTo(300,250);<br />
context.lineTo(200,300);<br />
context.lineTo(100,300);<br />
context.lineTo(200,300);<br />
context.stroke();<br />
<br />
context.strokeStyle = &quot;#ff0000&quot;;<br />
context.moveTo(200,300);<br />
context.lineTo(100,200);<br />
context.stroke();<br />
<br />
&lt;/script&gt;
</div>
<p>
If you save and run, you'll see that it does NOT work and the lines turn out red, which is the last strokeStyle we've attributed to our lines.
That's strange, right? 
</p>
<p>
Well, it turns out we need to discuss beginPath() which is really just a simple, self-explanatory little method. 
It takes no arguments and you place it in your code every time you want to start a line, arc, or whatever from the starting point.
Don't forget for lines, however, that you NEED to specify a moveTo() before any of your lines will show up on the canvas. Canvas needs to know
where you're starting from each time!
</p>
<p>
So the same thing applies when we call beginPath(). Don't forget that it's like starting over - after you call beginPath, the computer thinks this is 
the very first line you've drawn on your canvas, even though you might have already drawn 5,000 of them. So don't forget to call moveTo()
before you start drawing. Otherwise, nothing'll show up!
</p>
<p>
To demonstrate the capabilities of beginPath(), here's the same shape ("floral", I guess!) you drew in the clipping region section
redrawn in different colors:
</p>
<div id="code">

&lt;script&gt;<br />
<br />
var theCanvas = document.getElementById(&quot;canvas&quot;);<br />
var context = theCanvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);<br />
<br />
context.beginPath();<br />
context.lineWidth = 10;<br />
context.moveTo(200,100);<br />
context.strokeStyle = &quot;#ff0000&quot;;<br />
context.quadraticCurveTo(250,50,300,100);<br />
context.stroke();<br />
<br />
context.beginPath();<br />
context.lineWidth = 10;<br />
context.moveTo(300,100);<br />
context.strokeStyle = &quot;#440000&quot;;<br />
context.quadraticCurveTo(400,150,300,200);<br />
context.stroke();<br />
<br />
context.beginPath();<br />
context.lineWidth = 10;<br />
context.moveTo(300,200);<br />
context.strokeStyle = &quot;#006600&quot;;<br />
context.quadraticCurveTo(250,250,200,200);<br />
context.stroke();<br />
<br />
context.beginPath();<br />
context.lineWidth = 10;<br />
context.moveTo(200,200);<br />
context.strokeStyle = &quot;#0000dd&quot;;<br />
context.quadraticCurveTo(100,150,200,100);<br />
context.stroke();<br />
<br />
&lt;/script&gt;

</div>
<p>
How charming!
</p>
<p>
Note a few things: 
</p>
<p>
First off, I've given each of the line segments a width of 10 because if was a little difficult to see the different 
colors on such skinny little line segments. 
</p>
<p>
Secondly, I've assigned EACH path not only a specific width, but also needed to specify where to initially move to
with a moveTo() method, since every time I call a beginPath(), the computer has no idea where I should start from.
This, as you've seen in our other tutorials, is no problem if we're not dividing our lines into paths.
</p>
<p>
Thirdly, we need to call a stroke() mehod at the end of each segment so each one shows up on the screen. This
was also unecessary when we were drawing one, long path; we only needed to call one at the end.
</p>
<p>
So is it clear now? This will expand your field of possibilities in terms of the types of point-based drawings you can make.
</p>
<p>
Aaaaaaand that's everything I'd like to touch on for this lesson. Tomorrow we'll get into the last few points we need to deal with
before having learned everything you've ever wanted to learn about the canvas. After that we'll be able to change our focus
from the canvas to working on techniques that you'll need for making games.
</p>
<p>
So stay tuned and I hope you enjoyed! As always, thanks for following along! Code didn't work for you? Hate me? Are you my illegitimate child? 
Send input anytime!
</p>
<p>
Until tomorrow!
